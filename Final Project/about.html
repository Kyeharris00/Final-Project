		<p>Here at Vaporator we like to see ourselves as the "misssing link" that humanity needs to bring truth to conspiracy, since we all know lies are based on truth or the lack thereof. Vaporator is an organization cracking down on nonsense and bringing truth to our theories, as a means of informing the public about the secrets and objectives of the "secret society".   </p>

		<p>Many conspiray sights are full of bologna and are only tying to sell an idea with blurry images and some made up story that hardly makes sense. These sites make the ideology of conspiracy theories seem like child's play. The beginning of conspiracy was a means of communicating the concerns of the populace, and what they saw from their elected officials. To bring back the integrity of this ancient art, we give all our visitors a validity gurantee and we will never post anything that doesn't have a basis of truth. So no more worry Vaporator is the greatest conspiracy communicator.  </p>
